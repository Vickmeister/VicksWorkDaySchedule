# VicksWorkDaySchedule

Hello,

In this assignment, we have the work day planner starting at at 9am and ending at 5pm. 

All past times are colored in grey.
Present time is colored in green.
Future time is colored in blue.

The user can type their plans into the word boxes and hit the save buttons to the right. When the user saves and refreshes the page,
the content will still be there.

Thanks!

Vick
